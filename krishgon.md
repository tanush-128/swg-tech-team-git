I am a first year undergraduate student at IIT KGP pursuing the course of electronics and instrumentation engineering. I have been exploring the domains of coding from a very young age and have experience in a lot of them. Apart from this, I am a social person who loves to solve the problems around him.

My favorite Pok√©mon is Gengar because it's purple.
